INFM109 assignment
I am 48 years old, married with four children and four grandsons.  I am going to school to become a RN.  I also bake and decorate cakes for all occasions.  I am a two time cancer survivor and my story is on The 700 Club television show.  It aired May of 2019.  Type my name in their search bar and my story pops up towards bottom of page since it has been a few years now.  I have four cats and love to swim, travel, especially to the mountains.  I love amusement parks and love playing volleyball.
